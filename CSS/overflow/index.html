          Microservice architectures are the ‘new normal’. Building small,
          self-contained, ready to run applications can bring great flexibility
          and added resilience to your code. Spring Boot’s many purpose-built
          features make it easy to build and run your microservices in
          production at scale. And don’t forget, no microservice architecture is
          complete without Spring Cloud ‒ easing administration and boosting
          your fault-tolerance.
