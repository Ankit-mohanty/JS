    <h1>SpringBoot</h1>
    <div>
        <section id="padding">
            <p>Spring Boot helps you to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications that you can run. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries, so that you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration. 
                <br>
                You can use Spring Boot to create Java applications that can be started by using java -jar or more traditional war deployments.
                <br>
                Our primary goals are:
                <hr><br>
                Provide a radically faster and widely accessible getting-started experience for all Spring development.
                <br>
                Be opinionated out of the box but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
                <br>
                Provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects (such as embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration).
                <br>
                Absolutely no code generation (when not targeting native image) and no requirement for XML configuration.
                <br>
